# Turtle Graphics Projects

This repository contains projects created using Python's **Turtle graphics library**. These projects showcase different interactive and visual designs, including a spirograph, random color walk, and a drawing game where the Turtle is controlled with keyboard inputs.

## Projects

### 1. **Spirograph**
   - **Description**: This project generates a spirograph pattern using concentric circles. The Turtle moves in circular paths with varying radii, creating beautiful, overlapping geometric patterns.
   - **Features**:
     - The Turtle draws multiple circles with varying radii.
     - As the Turtle moves, it creates intricate overlapping shapes, resembling a spirograph.
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, Turtle

### 2. **Random Color Walk Pattern**
   - **Description**: This project creates a random walk pattern with the Turtle. The Turtle moves in random directions, changing its color at each step, which results in a vibrant, unpredictable design.
   - **Features**:
     - The Turtle moves randomly in different directions, generating a dynamic path.
     - The color of the lines changes randomly at each step, adding color variety to the design.
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, Turtle

### 3. **Drawing Game**
   - **Description**: This project is an interactive drawing game where the Turtle is controlled using the arrow keys or other specific keys. The player can move the Turtle around the screen to draw shapes or designs.
   - **Features**:
     - The Turtle's movement is controlled with keyboard inputs (e.g., arrow keys).
     - The game can include additional functionality like changing colors, erasing, or drawing specific shapes.
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, Turtle

## Getting Started

To run the projects on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Install Python (if you don't have it already). The `turtle` module is usually included by default in Python installations.

3. Navigate to the project folder and run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python project_name.py
   ```
